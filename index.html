            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>The word coffee entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie, borrowed in turn from the
                Arabic. The Arabic word qahwah was traditionally held to refer to a type of wine whose etymology is
                given by Arab lexicographers as deriving from the verb qahiya, 'to lack hunger', in reference to
                the drink's reputation as an appetite suppressant.
                The term coffee pot dates from 1705.[12] The expression coffee break was first attested in 1952.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of coffee dates back to 850 CE, and possibly earlier with a number of reports and legends surrounding its first use.
                There is evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree from the early 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen,[1] spreading soon to Mecca and Medina. By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, South India (Karnataka), Persia, Turkey, India, and northern Africa. Coffee then spread to the Balkans, Italy, and to the rest of Europe, as well as Southeast Asia despite the bans imposed during the 15th century by religious leaders in Mecca and Cairo, and later by the Catholic Church!</p>

            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole at the beginning of the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective process of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements.
                 Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the bean belt or coffee belt</p>
